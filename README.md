# Rice Crop Disease Detection using YOLO


Category: Deep Learning

Skills Required:
Python,CNN,Deep Learning,YOLO

Project Description:
 
Increasing grain production is essential to those areas where food is scarce.Increasing grain production by controlling crop diseases in time should be effective. To construct a prediction model for plant diseasesand to build a real-time application for crop diseasesin the future, deep learning-based image detection architecture with a custom backbone was proposed for detecting plant diseases.
In order to get a good amount of crop,we need to detectthe disease at the earliest.
Basically, crop disease diagnosis depends on different characteristics like color, shape, texture,etc. Here the person can capture the images of the crop and then the image will be sent to the trained YOLO model. The model analyzes the image and detects crop diseases like Bacterial Blight, Leaf Smut, and WhiteTip.

Project Objectives:
 
By the end of this projectyou’ll understand:
 
YOLO-based Convolution Neural Network familyof models for object detection and the most recent variationcalled YOLOv3.
How to train a YOLO modelin a windows environment.
 
How to annotate imagesusing Microsoft's Visual Object TaggingTool (VoTT).
